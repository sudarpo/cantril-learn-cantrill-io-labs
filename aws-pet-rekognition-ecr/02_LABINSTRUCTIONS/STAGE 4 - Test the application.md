# Rekognition-ECR Demo

In this part of the DEMO, you will be testing the application.

# STAGE 4 - Test the application

After 3-5 minutes, you should see the service `SkynetService` with the status `Active`.

- Click the `Tasks` tab and then click the task available to see the details. 
- Get the Public IP of the task and paste in a new tab. 
- You should get access to a simple web page where you can upload files of cats and dog to validate the model we trained in a previous stage. 

Bear in mind the following:

 * You need to upload a file with a cat or a dog but not a picture that contains both. If you upload a picture with both, the model will not be able to predict the correct class. The result of the prediction will be displayed in the web page with a single result (cat or dog).
 * The maximum size of the file is 15MB.
 * The file must be in JPG or PNG format.
 * The maximum for both width and height is 4096 pixels.
