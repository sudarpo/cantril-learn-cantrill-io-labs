# Rekognition-ECR Demo

To complete this stage, you will need first to have the Cloudfomation stack deployed. If you have not done so, please follow the section `1-Click Install` in the main README.md file.

In this part of the DEMO, you will be creating a few things:-

- An ECS cluster to deploy the application.
- An ECS task definition to define the application.
- An ECS service to deploy the application.

**Before you begin Stage 3**, we need to start the machine learning model.

Go back to the [Rekognition - Projects browser tab](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/custom-labels#/projects/skynet-cats-and-dogs), click in the model name to see the details of the model.  
Click on the "Use model" tab and then click on the **"Start"** button.  
Click again on the "Start" button that appears in the pop-up modal.  

Lastly, copy and save the **ARN** of the model that you will find in the same screen. You will need it in a later stage.

You can continue with STAGE3 while the model is starting.  

# STAGE 3 - Create the ECS cluster, ECS task definition and ECS service

## STAGE 3A - Create the ECS cluster

- Move to the ECS console: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#
- Select the **new ECS experience** in the left-hand menu to see the new ECS console.
- In the left-hand menu, click on `Clusters` and then click on the `Create cluster` button.
- Enter `SkynetCluster` as the name of the cluster.
- In the networking section select the VPC with the name `A4L-VPC` and the only subnet that is available.
- Click `Create` button.

## STAGE 3B - Create the ECS task definition

Before you can continue, you will need to have the stage 1 completed.

- In the left-hand menu, click on `Task definitions`.
- Click `Create new task definition` button.
- Enter `SkynetTaskDefinition` as the name of the task definition.
- In the container details section enter the following details:
    - Container name: `skynet`
    - Image URI: `ECR_IMAGE_URI:latest` (The one you got in the previous stage)
- In the environment variables section, add these 2 environment variables:
    - Key: BUCKET_NAME
    - Value: The output **"S3BucketName"** from the Cloudformation stack you deployed
    - Key: MODEL_ARN
    - Value: The one you got in the first stage
- Click `Next` button.
- In the Task size section change the CPU and Memory values to the following ones:
    - CPU: .5 vCPU
    - Memory: 1 GB
- For **both Task Role and Task Execution Role**, use the output **ECSRoleName** from the Cloudformation stack you deployed.
- In the Monitoring and logging section uncheck `Use log collection`.
- Click `Next` button and then click `Create` button.

## STAGE 3C - Create the ECS service

- In the left-hand menu, click on `Task definitions`.
- Select the `SkynetTaskDefinition` task definition, click `Deploy` button and then click `Create service`.
- In the existing cluster section select `SkynetCluster`.
- In the computer options section select **Launch type** and make sure the **`FARGATE` launch type** is selected.
- In the deployment configuration section enter `SkynetService` as the service name.
- In the networking section enter the following details:
    - VPC: `A4L-AWS`
    - Subnets: The only subnet that is available
    - Security group: The output **"SecurityGroup"** from the Cloudformation stack you deployed
    - Public IP: **Turned on**
- Click `Create` button.
