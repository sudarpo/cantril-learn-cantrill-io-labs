# Advanced Demo - Migrating a database with the Database Migration Service

In this advanced demo you will be migrating a simple web application (wordpress) from an on-premises environment into AWS.  
The on-premises environment is a virtual web server (simulated using EC2) and a self-managed mariaDB database server (also simulated via EC2)  
You will be migrating this into AWS and running the architecture on an EC2 webserver and RDS managed SQL database.

This advanced demo consists of 6 stages :-

- STAGE 1 : Provision the environment and review tasks 
- STAGE 2 : Establish Private Connectivity Between the environments (VPC Peer) 
- STAGE 3 : Create & Configure the AWS Side infrastructure (App and DB) **<= THIS STAGE**
- STAGE 4 : Migrate Database & Cutover
- STAGE 5 : Cleanup the account

# STAGE 3A - CREATE THE RDS INSTANCE

Move to the RDS Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1  
Click `Subnet Groups`  
Click `Create DB Subnet Group`  
For `Name` call it `A4LDBSNGROUP`
enter the same for description
in the `VPC` dropdown, choose `awsVPC`  
Under availability zones, choose `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`  
for subnets check the box next to `10.16.32.0/20` which is privateA and `10.16.96.0/20` which is privateB  
Scroll down and click `Create`  
Click on `Databases`  
Click `create Database`  
Choose `Standard Create`  
Choose `MariaDB`
Choose `Free Tier` for `Templates`  

You will be using the same database names and credentials to keep things simple for this demo lesson, but note that in production this could be different.

for `DB instance identifier` enter `a4lwordpress`  
for `Master username` choose `a4lwordpress`  
for `Masterpassword` enter the DBPassword parameter for cloudformation which you noted down in stage of this demo
enter that same password in the `Confirm password` box  
Scroll down to `Connectivity`  
for `Virtual private cloud (VPC)` choose `awsVPC`  
make sure `Subnet Groups` is set toe `a4ldbsngroup`  
for `public access` choose `No`  
for `VPC security groups` select `Choose Existing` and choose  `***-awsSecurityGroupDB-***` (*** aren't important)  
remove the `Default` security group by clicking the `X`    
Scroll down and expand `Additional configuration`  
Under `Initial database name` enter `a4lwordpress`  
Scroll down and click `Create Database`  

This will take some time.. and you cant continue to `Stage4` until the database is in a ready state.

# STAGE 3B - CREATE THE EC2 INSTANCE

Move to the EC2 Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Home:  
Click `Instances`  
Click `Launch Instances`  
Enter `awsCatWeb` for the Name of the instance.  
Clck `Amazon Linux` and ensure `Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) ...... SSD Volume Type` is selected.  
Ensuring the architecture is set to `64-bit (x86)` below.    
Choose the `Free Tier eligable` instance (should be t2.micro or t3.micro)  
Scroll down and choose `Proceed without key pair (not recommended)` in the dropdown  
Next to `Network Settings` click `Edit`  
For `VPC` pick `awsVPC`  
For `Subnet` pick `aws-PublicA`  
Select `Select an existing security group`  
Choose `***-awsSecurityGroupWeb-***` (*** aren't important)  
Scroll down past Storage and expand `Advanced Details` (don't confuse this with `Advanced Network Configuration` in the current area)  
for `IAM Instance Profile` pick `***-awsInstanceProfile-****` (*** aren't important)  
Click `Launch Instance`  
Click `View All Instances`  

Wait for the `awsCatWeb` instance to be in a `Running` state with `2/2 checks` before continuing.

# STAGE 3C - INSTALL WORDPRESS Requirements

Select the `awsCatWeb` instance, right click, `Connect`  
Select `Session Manager` and click `Connect`  
When connected type `sudo bash` to run a privileged bash shell
then update the instance with a `yum -y update` and wait for it to complete.  
Then install the apache web server with `yum -y install httpd mariadb`  (the mariadb part is for the mysql tools)
Then install php with `amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2 `  
then make sure apache is running and set to run at startup with 

```
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
```

You now have a running apache web server with the ability to connect to the wordpress database (currently running onpremises)

# STAGE 3D - MIGRATE WORDPRESS Content over

You're going to edit the SSH config on this machine to allow password authentication on a temporary basis.  
You will use this to copy the wordpress data across to the awsCatWeb machine from the on-premises CatWeb Machine.  

- run a `nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`  
- locate `PasswordAuthentication no` and change to `PasswordAuthentication yes` , then `ctrl+o` to save and `ctrl+x` to exit.  
- then set a password on the ec2-user user  
- run a `passwd ec2-user` and enter the `DBPassword` you noted down at the start of the demo.  

**this is only temporary.. we're using the same password throughout the demo to make things easier and less prone to mistakes**

- restart SSHD to make those changes with `service sshd restart` or `systemctl restart sshd`
- Return back to the EC2 console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:  
with the `awsCatWeb` instance selected, note down its `Private IPV4 Address` you will need this in a moment.  
- Select the `CatWeb` instance, right click, `Connect`  
- Select `Session Manager` and click `Connect`  
- When connected type `sudo bash` to run a privileged bash shell  
- move to the webroot folder by typing `cd /var/www/`  
- run a `scp -rp html ec2-user@privateIPofawsCatWeb:/home/ec2-user` and answer `yes` to the authenticity warning.  
- this will copy the wordpress local files from `CatWeb` (on-premises) to `awsCatWeb` (aws)

**now move back to the `awsCatWeb` server, if you dont have it open still, reconnect as per below**

- Select the `awsCatWeb` instance, right click, `Connect`  
- Select `Session Manager` and click `Connect`  
- When connected type `sudo bash` to run a privileged bash shell
- move to the `ec2-user` home folder by doing a `cd /home/ec2-user`  
- then do an `ls -la` and you should see the html folder you just copied.  
`cd html`  
- next copy all of these files into the webroot of `awsCatWeb` by doing a `cp * -R /var/www/html/`


# STAGE 3E - Fix Up Permissions & verify `awsCatWeb` works

run the following commands to enforce the correct permissions on the files you've just copied across

```
usermod -a -G apache ec2-user   
chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
chmod 2775 /var/www
find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;
sudo systemctl restart httpd
```

Move to the EC2 running instances console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:  
Select the `awsCatWeb` instance  
copy down its `public IPv4 DNS` into your clipboard and open it in a new tab  
if working, this Web Instance (aws) is now loading using the on-premises database.


# STAGE 3 - FINISH   

At this point you have a functional AWS based wordpress application instance.  
You have migrated content from the on-premises virtual machine (simulated) using SCP.  
And you have tested that its connects to the on-premises DB.
In the next stage you will migrate the on-premises DB to AWS using DMS.
**before you continue, make sure the a4lwordpress RDS DB is in an Available state** https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#databases:
